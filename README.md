# Customer-Churn-Predicting
Creating a model Whether or not a Customer will Churn
 
What is Churn?

Churn means simply someone ending their service.


For example : Many people take subscriptions of Amazon Prime/Netflix and churn after 1 or 2 months  etc. So, Churn Prediction is essentially predicting which customers are most likely to cancel a subscription i.e in business terms :  ‘leave a company’ based on their usage of the service.


Generally customers churn when the services are not upto the mark and there are many factors they may churn.

Here I have created a model whether or not a customer will churn, and I have used only tree based models (A Single Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost) and compared the results of them.
